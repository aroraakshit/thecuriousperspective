## Summary
Finding a healthy and lasting love is one of the hardest and most fulfilling journeys we all go through as human beings. It is a journey that entails the happiest moments of our lives and at the same time may leave scars for life, and that is if we are lucky. But one thing is for sure, it is exciting, empowering and (most importantly) worth it. It teaches us a lot about ourselves and (indirectly) affects the value we provide to this world. 

There is plenty of content/books/blogs out there that describe different ways to think about this journey, and I have (clearly) not gone through all of them. Within the limited content I did review, I connected the most with this particular book, and so here we are!

In this book, the author (Ken), proposes this idea of `Core Gifts` as key to finding love and further describes ways to:
1. Look within and find these core-gifts (by asking ourselves certain questions)
2. Accept and enjoy our core-gifts
3. Learn to lead these core-gifts in our dating lives

Now, I connected with this book because:
- I believe that the answers to all of our "problems" are within us, if only we knew the right questions to ask :-)
    - As opposed to giving a prescriptive advice based on "tricks" that work for "most" people around the world to find love, this book lists a number of such questions to ask ourselves, that help us arrive at our core-gifts. 
    - Furthermore, the book also describes examples on how to answer the questions by providing anecdotes/experiences from author's (who is a licensed clinical social worker) clients journeys.
- If you are reading this book, or this blog post (so far :-P), chances are, you have some relationship history, why not use that to learn more about yourself?
    - One of the key ways to identify our core gifts is by understanding our the why and how of our attractions (i.e. what we feel attracted towards in our partner). The book helps develop that understanding by asking the right questions around our past relationships. 
- The struggle of self-discovery is universal, the pain is real, and but it does not mean we have to go through it alone. 
    - This book is structured to be completed with a learning partner. Ken shares how to find a learning partner and also provides an online tool to find one (in case you are unable to find a partner in your own social circle).

If you connected with what I described above, this book is for you! 

Feel free to reach out to me if you are looking for a learning partner - happy to connect you with others who are looking for a learning partner as well. 

Below are some of my highlights from each of the chapters in the book, feel free to skip if you are already convinced and plan to read the book with a learning partner soon!

## Chapter-wise highlights

### Introduction: The New Map to Love
Ken starts off by describing the struggle to find love, instantly connecting with the audience by giving anecdotes and examples of all the "love advice" we've heard from countless sources - and how it all may work for finding short-term relationships/hookups, but does not work for finding healthy and lasting love. Instead, what Ken suggests, as the new map to love, is that the very imperfections that we are usually advised to fix, are the keys to finding love. 

Here are some of my highlights from this section:

> “What are they telling you to do? Lose weight, dress better, play hard to get, act confident, get out there more—in other words, fix yourself if you ever hope to find love.”

> “The real search for love is about embracing our most authentic self, sharing that true self with the precious people who know how to honor it, and learning to offer others the same in return. The amazing paradox is that the parts of our personality we think we must fix in order to find love are usually the keys to finding that love”
